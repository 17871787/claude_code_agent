# Build Brief: Storage Foundation Layer

## Executive Summary
**Idea ID:** storage-foundation-e1  
**Priority:** 1 (Critical Infrastructure)  
**Timeline:** 2 weeks  
**Score:** 0.7645

A robust, compressed, versioned localStorage abstraction layer that provides 10x data capacity with automatic chunking, migration support, and write optimization. This foundation enables all other features and must be implemented first.

## Goal
Create a unified storage manager that abstracts localStorage complexity, providing compression, chunking, versioning, and batch writes while maintaining 100% reliability and zero data loss.

## User Story
As a time tracking user, I want my data to be reliably stored with unlimited history so that I can analyze long-term patterns and never lose my tracked time, even with localStorage's 5MB limit.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **StorageManager Class**
   - Single point of entry for all storage operations
   - Automatic compression/decompression
   - Key namespacing and chunk management

2. **Compression Layer**
   - LZ-string compression (70-90% reduction for JSON)
   - Transparent compression on write, decompression on read
   - Fallback for incompressible data

3. **Chunking System**
   - Split large datasets across multiple localStorage keys
   - Smart key rotation with metadata tracking
   - Automatic defragmentation

4. **Migration Engine**
   - Schema versioning with version key
   - Migration function registry
   - Automatic backup before migration
   - Rollback capability

5. **Write Optimization**
   - Request queue with priorities
   - Batch writes with 5-second debounce
   - Write-ahead log for crash recovery
   - requestIdleCallback for performance

### Data Schema
```javascript
localStorage keys:
- `vl_meta`: Metadata about storage system
- `vl_version`: Current schema version
- `vl_data_[chunk]`: Compressed data chunks
- `vl_wal`: Write-ahead log
- `vl_index`: Chunk index mapping

Structure:
{
  meta: {
    version: "1.0.0",
    chunks: ["vl_data_0", "vl_data_1"],
    compression: "lz-string",
    created: timestamp,
    updated: timestamp
  },
  index: {
    "entries": "vl_data_0",
    "predictions": "vl_data_1"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Storage (3 days)
- [ ] StorageManager class with get/set/delete
- [ ] LZ compression integration
- [ ] Basic error handling

### Phase 2: Chunking (3 days)
- [ ] Chunk splitting algorithm
- [ ] Index management
- [ ] Defragmentation

### Phase 3: Optimization (3 days)
- [ ] Write queue implementation
- [ ] Batch write logic
- [ ] WAL for reliability

### Phase 4: Migration (2 days)
- [ ] Version management
- [ ] Migration registry
- [ ] Backup/restore

### Phase 5: Testing (3 days)
- [ ] Unit tests for each component
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Edge case handling

## Success Metrics
- **Capacity:** 10x increase in storable data (50MB effective)
- **Performance:** <10ms read, <50ms write latency
- **Reliability:** Zero data loss across 1000 operations
- **Compression:** 70%+ reduction in storage size

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Compression overhead | Performance degradation | Selective compression, async where possible |
| Migration bugs | Data loss | Comprehensive backup, dry-run mode |
| Storage quota exceeded | Feature failure | Graceful degradation, user notification |
| Browser compatibility | Limited reach | Feature detection, polyfills |

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Compression/decompression accuracy
   - Chunking algorithm correctness
   - Migration function execution

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Full read/write cycle
   - Concurrent operations
   - Storage limit handling

3. **Performance Tests**
   - 10,000 entry stress test
   - Compression ratio verification
   - Latency measurements

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Corrupt data recovery
   - Migration rollback
   - Storage quota exhaustion

## Dependencies
- **External:** None (zero-dependency)
- **Internal:** None (foundation layer)

## Enables Future Features
- Undo system (persistent history)
- Predictive suggestions (extensive training data)
- Offline PWA (reliable local data)
- Performance optimizations (batched writes)
