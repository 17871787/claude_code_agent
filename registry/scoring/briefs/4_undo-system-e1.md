# Build Brief: Universal Undo/Redo System

## Executive Summary
**Idea ID:** undo-system-e1  
**Priority:** 4 (Fundamental UX)  
**Timeline:** 2.5 weeks  
**Score:** 0.7515

Comprehensive undo/redo system with universal action coverage, visual history timeline, and session persistence. Eliminates fear of mistakes and increases user exploration by 90%.

## Goal
Implement a robust undo/redo system that works for ALL actions (not just text), provides visual history, persists across sessions, and gives users complete confidence to explore and experiment.

## User Story
As a user, I want to undo any action I take in the app and see my history of changes so that I can fearlessly explore features and recover from any mistake without anxiety.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Command Pattern Implementation**
   - Abstract Command class
   - Execute/Undo/Redo methods
   - Serializable state

2. **History Manager**
   - Dual stack (undo/redo)
   - Memory-bounded (last 50 actions)
   - Session persistence
   - Selective undo support

3. **Command Registry**
   - Time entry commands
   - Settings changes
   - Data modifications
   - UI state changes

4. **Visual History Timeline**
   - Scrollable action list
   - Preview on hover
   - Jump to any point
   - Grouping related actions

5. **Persistence Layer**
   - Serialize to localStorage
   - Compress command data
   - Session recovery
   - Cleanup old sessions

### Data Schema
```javascript
localStorage keys:
- `undo_history`: Current undo stack
- `redo_history`: Current redo stack
- `undo_session`: Session metadata
- `undo_snapshots`: State snapshots

Command Structure:
{
  id: "cmd_123",
  type: "TimeEntryCreate",
  timestamp: 1234567890,
  description: "Added time entry",
  data: {
    before: null,
    after: { entry object }
  },
  groupId: "group_456" // Optional
}

Session Structure:
{
  sessionId: "session_789",
  started: timestamp,
  lastAction: timestamp,
  commandCount: 45,
  maxSize: 50
}
```

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Execute/undo logic

### Phase 2: History Manager (3 days)
- [ ] Undo/redo stacks
- [ ] Memory management
- [ ] Command execution

### Phase 3: Persistence (3 days)
- [ ] Serialization logic
- [ ] localStorage integration
- [ ] Session recovery

### Phase 4: Visual Timeline (3 days)
- [ ] Timeline component
- [ ] Preview system
- [ ] Navigation controls

### Phase 5: Integration (2.5 days)
- [ ] Wire up all actions
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts

## Success Metrics
- **Coverage:** 100% of user actions undoable
- **Performance:** <50ms undo/redo operation
- **Reliability:** Zero data corruption across 10,000 operations
- **Usage:** 90% increase in feature exploration

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Memory overflow | Performance degradation | Bounded history, snapshot compression |
| State corruption | Data loss | Validation, atomic operations |
| Complex interactions | Inconsistent state | Transaction grouping, validation |
| Storage limits | Feature failure | Automatic cleanup, compression |

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Each command type
   - Stack operations
   - Serialization

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Multi-step undo/redo
   - Session persistence
   - Edge cases

3. **Stress Tests**
   - 1000 rapid operations
   - Memory limits
   - Storage capacity

4. **User Tests**
   - Intuitive behavior
   - Visual feedback
   - Recovery scenarios

## Dependencies
- **External:** None
- **Internal:** storage-foundation-e1 (for persistence)

## Command Types

### Time Entry Commands
