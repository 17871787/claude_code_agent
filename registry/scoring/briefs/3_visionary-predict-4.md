# Build Brief: Predictive Description System

## Executive Summary
**Idea ID:** visionary-predict-4  
**Priority:** 3 (Strategic Differentiator)  
**Timeline:** 2 weeks  
**Score:** 0.7544

ML-lite autocomplete system with time-aware suggestion ranking that learns personal vocabulary and patterns. Reduces description entry time by 60% through intelligent predictions that improve with usage.

## Goal
Build a smart prediction engine that suggests time entry descriptions based on time of day, day of week, recent entries, and learned patterns, making time tracking faster and more accurate with each use.

## User Story
As a time tracker, I want the system to predict what I'm working on based on patterns so that I can log time with minimal typing and maintain consistent descriptions across entries.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Trie Data Structure**
   - Fast prefix matching
   - Memory-efficient storage
   - Supports fuzzy matching

2. **Pattern Learning Engine**
   - Time-bucketed frequencies
   - Day-of-week patterns
   - Project sequence detection
   - Vocabulary learning

3. **Ranking Algorithm**
   - Recency weight: 30%
   - Frequency weight: 25%
   - Time similarity: 25%
   - Context match: 20%

4. **Suggestion UI**
   - Inline autocomplete
   - Dropdown with top 5
   - Keyboard navigation
   - One-click selection

5. **Training System**
   - Implicit learning from selections
   - Explicit training mode
   - Pattern correction
   - Cold start handling

### Data Schema
```javascript
localStorage keys:
- `predict_trie`: Trie structure for fast lookup
- `predict_patterns`: Time-based patterns
- `predict_vocab`: Personal vocabulary
- `predict_stats`: Usage statistics

Structure:
{
  patterns: {
    hourly: {
      "09": ["Daily standup", "Email review"],
      "14": ["Code review", "Development"]
    },
    daily: {
      "monday": ["Sprint planning", "Team sync"],
      "friday": ["Weekly report", "Cleanup"]
    },
    sequences: [
      ["Design", "Implementation", "Testing"],
      ["Research", "Prototype", "Documentation"]
    ]
  },
  vocabulary: {
    "standup": { count: 45, lastUsed: timestamp },
    "development": { count: 120, lastUsed: timestamp }
  },
  stats: {
    predictions_made: 1250,
    predictions_accepted: 980,
    accuracy_rate: 0.784
  }
}
```

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Cold start problem | Poor initial experience | Pre-seed with common patterns |
| Storage limits | Feature degradation | LRU cache, data pruning |
| Wrong predictions | User frustration | Easy dismissal, learning from rejections |
| Privacy concerns | Reduced adoption | Local-only storage, clear data option |

## Testing Strategy
1. **Algorithm Tests**
   - Trie correctness
   - Pattern detection accuracy
   - Ranking quality

2. **Performance Tests**
   - Lookup speed (<10ms)
   - Memory usage
   - Storage efficiency

3. **User Tests**
   - Prediction relevance
   - UI responsiveness
   - Learning curve

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Empty history
   - Unusual patterns
   - Storage limits

## Dependencies
- **External:** None
- **Internal:** storage-foundation-e1 (for efficient storage)

## Enables Future Features
- Smart context switching detection
- Automated time entry
- Project prediction
- Team pattern sharing (future)

## Algorithm Details

### Time Bucketing
```javascript
Morning: 6-12 (2-hour buckets)
Afternoon: 12-18 (2-hour buckets)
Evening: 18-24 (3-hour buckets)
Weekend: Different pattern set
```

### Ranking Formula
```javascript
score = (recency * 0.3) + 
        (frequency * 0.25) + 
        (timeSimilarity * 0.25) + 
        (contextMatch * 0.2)

where:
- recency = 1 / (hoursSinceLastUse + 1)
- frequency = uses / totalUses
- timeSimilarity = 1 - (timeDiff / 24)
- contextMatch = previousEntryMatch ? 1 : 0
```

### Learning Rate
- First 10 uses: High weight (2x)
- 10-50 uses: Normal weight (1x)
- 50+ uses: Stable weight (0.5x)

## UI Specifications

### Autocomplete Display
- Trigger: After 2 characters typed
- Position: Below input field
- Max items: 5 suggestions
- Format: `[description] - [last used] - [confidence %]`

### Keyboard Shortcuts
