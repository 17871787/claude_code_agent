# Build Brief: Progressive UX System

## Executive Summary
**Idea ID:** progressive-ux-e1  
**Priority:** 2 (Quick Win)  
**Timeline:** 1.5 weeks  
**Score:** 0.762

An adaptive user experience system with skill-aware progressive disclosure, just-in-time learning, and integrated command palette. Reduces time-to-productivity by 75% while maintaining power-user efficiency.

## Goal
Create an intelligent onboarding and help system that reveals features progressively based on user skill level, providing contextual guidance exactly when needed without overwhelming new users or annoying experts.

## User Story
As a new user, I want to learn features as I need them rather than all upfront, so I can start being productive immediately and discover advanced features naturally over time.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Feature Usage Tracker**
   - Track which features have been used
   - Count usage frequency
   - Identify skill level per feature area

2. **Progressive Disclosure Engine**
   - Show/hide UI elements based on skill
   - Contextual help bubbles
   - Smart tooltip timing

3. **Command Palette**
   - Cmd/Ctrl+K activation
   - Fuzzy search for all commands
   - Recent commands priority
   - Custom aliases support

4. **Just-in-Time Help**
   - Detect when user might need help
   - Show hints after relevant actions
   - Dismissible with "got it" buttons
   - Re-discovery mechanism

5. **Skill Assessment**
   - Beginner/Intermediate/Expert levels
   - Per-feature skill tracking
   - Adaptive UI complexity

### Data Schema
```javascript
localStorage keys:
- `ux_skills`: User skill levels
- `ux_usage`: Feature usage stats
- `ux_dismissed`: Dismissed hints
- `ux_preferences`: UI preferences

Structure:
{
  skills: {
    overall: "intermediate",
    features: {
      "time-entry": "expert",
      "predictions": "beginner",
      "undo": "intermediate"
    }
  },
  usage: {
    "time-entry": { count: 150, lastUsed: timestamp },
    "predictions": { count: 5, lastUsed: timestamp }
  },
  hints: {
    shown: ["hint-1", "hint-2"],
    dismissed: ["hint-3"],
    snoozed: { "hint-4": untilTimestamp }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Usage Tracking (2 days)
- [ ] Event tracking system
- [ ] localStorage persistence
- [ ] Skill level calculation

### Phase 2: Progressive UI (3 days)
- [ ] Feature visibility rules
- [ ] UI element tagging
- [ ] Progressive reveal logic

### Phase 3: Command Palette (2 days)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut handler
- [ ] Fuzzy search implementation
- [ ] Command registry

### Phase 4: Contextual Help (2 days)
- [ ] Hint trigger system
- [ ] Tooltip component
- [ ] Dismissal tracking

### Phase 5: Polish (1.5 days)
- [ ] Animations and transitions
- [ ] Accessibility
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Success Metrics
- **Onboarding:** 75% reduction in time-to-first-value
- **Discovery:** 90% of features discovered within first week
- **Efficiency:** 5x speed increase for power users via shortcuts
- **Satisfaction:** <5% help dismissal rate

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Hint fatigue | User annoyance | Frequency limits, smart timing |
| Discovery problem | Features hidden | Command palette as escape hatch |
| Skill misassessment | Poor UX | Manual override, quick adjustment |
| Performance overhead | Slow UI | Debounced tracking, async processing |

## Testing Strategy
1. **User Journey Tests**
   - New user onboarding flow
   - Feature discovery path
   - Power user efficiency

2. **Component Tests**
   - Command palette search
   - Tooltip display logic
   - Skill calculation

3. **A/B Testing**
   - Progressive vs traditional onboarding
   - Hint frequency optimization
   - Command palette adoption

## Dependencies
- **External:** None
- **Internal:** None (parallel with storage)

## Enables Future Features
- All future features benefit from progressive disclosure
- Command palette becomes central navigation
- Usage data informs feature development
- Foundation for AI-powered suggestions
